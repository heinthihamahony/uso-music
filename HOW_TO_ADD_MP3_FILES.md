# How to Add MP3 Song Files to Your Music Website

## 🎵 Complete Guide to Adding MP3 Files

### 📁 Step 1: Prepare Your MP3 Files

1. **Create audio folders** (already done):

   ```
   /public/audio/          # For public MP3 files
   /app/audio/            # For app-specific audio files
   ```

2. **Add your MP3 files** to the `/public/audio/` folder:
   ```
   /public/audio/
   ├── my-song-1.mp3
   ├── my-song-2.mp3
   ├── my-song-3.mp3
   └── ...
   ```

### 🎯 Step 2: Add Songs with MP3 Files

#### Method 1: Direct File Editing

Edit `/app/data/songs.ts` and add your song:

```tsx
{
  id: 13, // Next available ID
  title: "Your Song Title",
  artist: "Your Name",
  avatar: "/app/IMG/very amazing song cover.jpeg",
  category: "My Songs",
  audioFile: "/audio/your-song.mp3", // MP3 file path
  duration: "3:45", // Optional duration
},
```

#### Method 2: Using Helper Functions

```tsx
import { addNewSong, createSong } from "./data/songs";

const newSong = addNewSong(
  createSong(
    "Your Song Title",
    "Your Name",
    "/app/IMG/very amazing song cover.jpeg",
    "My Songs",
    "/audio/your-song.mp3", // MP3 file path
    "3:45" // Duration
  )
);
```

### 🎮 Step 3: Display Songs with MP3 Files

#### Show All Songs with MP3 Files:

```tsx
import CardComponent from "./compounent/ui/card";
import { getSongsWithAudio } from "./data/songs";

<CardComponent songs={getSongsWithAudio()} title="Songs with MP3 Files" />;
```

#### Show Your Custom Songs:

```tsx
import { getMyCustomSongs } from "./data/songs";

<CardComponent songs={getMyCustomSongs()} title="My Custom Songs" />;
```

### 🎧 How the Audio Player Works

When you add a song with an `audioFile`, the card component automatically:

- ✅ Shows a play button
- ✅ Displays song title and artist
- ✅ Shows progress bar
- ✅ Shows current time and duration
- ✅ Allows play/pause functionality

### 📝 Complete Example

Here's exactly how to add your MP3 song:

1. **Put your MP3 file** in `/public/audio/my-song.mp3`

2. **Add to songs data** in `/app/data/songs.ts`:

```tsx
{
  id: 13,
  title: "My Amazing Song",
  artist: "Hein Thiha",
  avatar: "/app/IMG/very amazing song cover.jpeg",
  category: "My Songs",
  audioFile: "/audio/my-song.mp3",
  duration: "3:30",
},
```

3. **Display it** in your component:

```tsx
import CardComponent from "./compounent/ui/card";
import { getMyCustomSongs } from "./data/songs";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CardComponent songs={getMyCustomSongs()} title="My MP3 Songs" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
