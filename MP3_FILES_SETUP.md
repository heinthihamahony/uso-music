# 🎵 MP3 Files Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've successfully set up your music app to play MP3 files with visual indicators! Here's what's ready:

### 🎯 **Songs with MP3 Files Added:**

1. **"Ignite the Sky"** → `Ignite-the-Sky.mp3`
2. **"Golden Light"** → `Golden-Light.mp3`
3. **"Money is there! My Honey Is Where?"** → `Pracha Songkhro Rd. 59 (Cover).mp3`

### 🎧 **Features Added:**

- ✅ Global audio state management
- ✅ Visual playing indicators on cards
- ✅ Green glow effect when song is playing
- ✅ "NOW PLAYING" text with animated dots
- ✅ Only one song plays at a time
- ✅ Automatic pause when switching songs

## 📁 **How to Add Your MP3 Files**

### Step 1: Put Your MP3 Files in the Right Place

Put these 3 MP3 files in the `/public/audio/` folder:

```
/public/audio/
├── Ignite-the-Sky.mp3
├── Golden-Light.mp3
└── Pracha Songkhro Rd. 59 (Cover).mp3
```

### Step 2: Test Your Music App

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your music app in the browser
3. Look for the three songs with MP3 files
4. Click the play button on any song
5. You should see:
   - Green glow around the card
   - Green play button
   - "NOW PLAYING" text with animated dots
   - Song title turns green

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators When Playing:**

### Card Effects:

- **Green ring** around the card border
- **Green shadow** effect
- **Smooth transitions** when starting/stopping

### Audio Player Effects:

- **Green play button** instead of white
- **Green song title** text
- **Animated dots** (●●●) next to "NOW PLAYING"
- **Progress bar** showing song progress

## 🎵 **How It Works:**

1. **Click play** on any song with MP3
2. **Previous song stops** automatically
3. **New song starts** playing
4. **Visual indicators** show which song is playing
5. **Click play again** to pause
6. **Click another song** to switch

## 🔧 **File Structure:**

```
/public/audio/                    ← Put your MP3 files here
