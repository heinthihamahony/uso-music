# ✅ Errors Fixed Successfully!

## 🐛 **Issues Found and Resolved:**

### 1. **Missing Component Imports** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** The app was trying to import components that don't exist:

- `./compounent/ui/editor's-choice`
- `./compounent/ui/new-releases`

**Solution:** Removed the non-existent imports from `app/page.tsx`

### 2. **TypeScript Type Errors** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** Type mismatch in example files:

- `createSong()` returns `Omit<Song, 'id'>`
- But components expected `Song[]` (with required `id` field)

**Solution:** Fixed by adding `id` field to song objects in examples:

```tsx
// Before (Error)
const songs = [createSong(...)]; // Missing id

// After (Fixed)
const songs = [
  { id: 100, ...createSong(...) }, // Added id
  { id: 101, ...createSong(...) }
];
```

## 🎯 **Files Fixed:**

1. **`app/page.tsx`** - Removed non-existent imports
2. **`app/examples/mp3-integration-example.tsx`** - Fixed type errors
3. **`app/examples/my-custom-songs-example.tsx`** - Fixed type errors
